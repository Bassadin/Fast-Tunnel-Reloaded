Hello Guys!

This is my GitHub repo of Fast Tunnel Reloaded, my remake of "Fast Tunnel" which you most likely don't know. It's a very simple and basic 2D-Arcade-"Tunnel-Running-Game". In this remake I will share everything I do with you so especially the ones new to Love2d can follow me.

You can also watch my Videos on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/DestructiveRealityDE) but they are in german ;)

The reason because I'm writing english here is that everyone can understand it and if you want to program, you have to know good english anyway.

Have fun with this repo,

Bastian Hodapp alias VADS, Destructive Reality
